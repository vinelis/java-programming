    The objective of this game is to travel the entire game board of 20 spaces within 5 die rolls.
    After each roll, tell the user which game space they are on and how many more spaces they have to go to win
    Repeat this 4 additional times, for 5 rolls in total.
    However, if the user gets to 20 before 5 rolls, end the game - theyâ€™ve won.
    If they are greater than or less than 20 spaces exactly, they lose.
